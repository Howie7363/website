			<h1>Our Story</h1>
			<p>During our first season (2018-2019), we were very successful even with no prior FRC experience. At the Miami Valley Regional competition we attended, 
				our team was ranked first out of 60 teams for the first two days, and we finished the competition ranked eighth. For our hard work, perseverance,
				and strong performance as a rookie team, we were honored to receive the Top Seed Rookie award and the Rookie Inspiration award. Following, our team
				was invited to the WOW Invitational as one of the top teams of Ohio, West Virginia, and Western Pennsylvania.
